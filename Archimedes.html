            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes"><b>Archimedes of Syracuse</b></a> was a Greek scholar who made remarkable contributions to mathematics, physics, and engineering. He pioneered methods that laid the groundwork for calculus and used innovative techniques to solve geometric problems, including calculating areas, volumes, and the value of pi. In physics, he formulated the principle of buoyancy and explored the concepts of balance and gravity. His ingenuity extended to engineering, where he developed practical inventions like the screw pump and defensive machines to protect Syracuse. Though his mathematical work was not widely recognized during his lifetime, later scholars compiled and translated his writings, influencing scientific progress in the Renaissance and beyond. He was tragically killed during the Roman siege of Syracuse, despite orders for his safety.</p>
